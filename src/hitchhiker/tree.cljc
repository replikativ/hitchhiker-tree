(ns hitchhiker.tree
  "Default tree implementation

  The parts of the serialization system that seem like they're need hooks are:

  * Must provide a function that takes a node, serializes it, and returns an addr

  * Must be able to rollback writing an addr

  * Whatever the addr it returns, it should cache its resolve in-mem
  somehow

  * The serialize a node & rollback a node functions should accept a
  'stats' object as well

  * The 'stats' object must be convertible to a summary or whatever at the end"
